This repository contains source files required to compile the RMarkdown notebook that accompanies the following talk at [StanCon 2019](https://mc-stan.org/events/stancon2019Cambridge/):

- **Bayesian analyses of time-to-event data using the rstanarm R package** by Eren M. El&ccedil;i and Sam Brilleman

A [compiled PDF version](https://github.com/ermeel86/surv_stan_stancon2019/blob/master/survmodelsrstanarm.pdf) of the notebook is included in the repository's root directory. To compile the notebook yourself, you will need to run the [RMarkdown file](https://github.com/ermeel86/surv_stan_stancon2019/blob/master/survmodelsrstanarm.Rmd) in the root directory, and have the following R packages installed (including their dependencies): **knitr**, **tidyverse**, **cowplot**, **bayesplot**, **survival**, **rstanarm**, **loo**, **pec** and **survRM2**.

**Note:** At the time of writing this, the version of **rstanarm** that is required is the development version available [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/tree/feature/frailty-models) since this contains the `stan_surv` modelling function, however, this will be uploaded to CRAN in the near future, so it may be worth checking [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm/index.html) whether **rstanarm** version >=2.19.0 has been released on CRAN. If it has, then it would be easier to install the package directly from within R by calling `install.packages("rstanarm")` instead of downloading the development version from GitHub.
